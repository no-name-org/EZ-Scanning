# EZ Scan

## Project Concept

### Statement of the Problem
There has been a big problem with long queues during payment in different grocery stores for a very long time and can cause people to lose lots of their time. Not only is the line a problem but another hassle is the mode of payment you do when you start paying. This proposal tackles all of those problems and improves efficiency in grocery stores. 

### Proposed Solution
This project aims to make a grocery of the future. Where in you buy items in the store by scanning the QR Code available. Not only does this make grocery shopping more efficient, but it also lessens shoplifting incidents that may occur since no physical items are being shown. For mode of payment, bitcoins will be used as currency for shopping. This is to make transactions faster by scanning your phone and deducting the cost of the items bought in your total bitcoin load.

### Target Users
Our target users are grocery customers. Itâ€™s the ideal target since it can help them estimate their budget with the app help display the prices for the products as well as providing an overall sum of the products bought.

### Benefits
Well for one, we would help provide a much more comfortable way to compute all the items the consumer has accumulated. Not only will it help provide an overview of the prices for the products bought, we can also help them save time in preparing a grocery list when they can selectively pick items on the fly as the app will jot down all items bought. This will also help them save time in finding a scanner to know what the price is for the certain item.
